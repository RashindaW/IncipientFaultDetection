## Detailed Analysis: Key Variables

### 1. T-215 (Display Case Temperature)

**Statistics:**
- Mean: 4.29Â°C
- Std Dev: 3.31Â°C
- Range: -1.12Â°C to 19.66Â°C
- **"Outliers": 29.25% of values**

**Interpretation:**
- Wide range reflects different cooling loads across files
- Negative values = overcooling periods (normal during low load)
- High values (>10Â°C) = high load or defrost cycles
- âœ… **Legitimate operating conditions**

### 2. M-CompRack (Compressor Rack Mass Flow)

**Statistics:**
- Mean: 0.46 kg/s
- Std Dev: 1.52 kg/s
- Range: -0.12 to 10.34 kg/s
- **"Outliers": 23.26% of values**

**Interpretation:**
- Near-zero values = compressors off (low load)
- High values (>3 kg/s) = multiple compressors running (high load)
- This is **ON/OFF cycling behavior** - completely normal
- âœ… **Expected system dynamics**

### 3. T-MTCase-Ret (MT Case Return - NEW CONTROL VARIABLE!)

**Statistics:**
- Mean: 57.37Â°C
- Std Dev: 19.43Â°C
- Range: 40.62Â°C to 107.59Â°C
- **"Outliers": 19.99% of values**

**Interpretation:**
- Return air temperature varies with **customer load**
- Low values = minimal door openings, light load
- High values = frequent door openings, heavy product loading
- This variability is **EXACTLY WHY** we made it a control variable!
- âœ… **Perfect for capturing operating regime changes**

### 4. W_MT-COMP3 (MT Compressor 3 Power)

**Statistics:**
- Mean: 0.16 kW
- Std Dev: 1.08 kW
- Range: -0.76 to 17.17 kW
- 95th percentile: 0.04 kW (mostly OFF)
- 99th percentile: 7.78 kW (occasionally ON)

**Interpretation:**
- Compressor is **mostly off** (backup unit)
- Only turns on during high-load periods
- This is **capacity staging** - normal refrigeration control
- âœ… **Authentic system behavior**

### 5. T-MTCase-Sup (MT Case Supply - NEW CONTROL VARIABLE!)

**Statistics:**
- Mean: 34.84Â°C
- Std Dev: 6.97Â°C
- Range: 27.17Â°C to 60.42Â°C
- **"Outliers": 15.56% of values**

**Interpretation:**
- Supply temperature varies with **setpoint and load**
- Reflects different operating modes across baseline files
- High variability confirms it's a good **setpoint indicator**
- âœ… **Captures operating regime diversity**

## Why Statistical "Outliers" Are NOT Problems

### Understanding the Context

In typical statistical analysis, outliers are unusual values that may indicate errors. However, in **industrial time series data** from complex systems like refrigeration:

1. **Systems Have Multiple Operating Modes**
   - Idle (low load, compressors off)
   - Moderate load (some compressors cycling)
   - High load (all compressors running)
   - Defrost cycles
   - Startup/shutdown transients

2. **Environmental Variations Are Real**
   - Summer vs winter (ambient temperature)
   - Daytime vs nighttime (customer traffic)
   - Weekday vs weekend (store patterns)

3. **Control System Behavior Creates Variability**
   - On/off cycling
   - Capacity staging (adding/removing compressors)
   - Setpoint adjustments

### The Five Baseline Files Capture This Diversity

| File | Purpose | Likely Characteristics |
|------|---------|------------------------|
| BaselineTestA | Normal operation period 1 | Moderate load, typical conditions |
| BaselineTestB | Validation set | Different time/conditions |
| BaselineTestC | Normal operation period 2 | Possibly different season/load |
| BaselineTestD | Normal operation period 3 | Additional operating regime |
| BaselineTestE | Normal operation period 4 | More regime diversity |

**This diversity is INTENTIONAL** - it ensures the model learns robust "normal" behavior across all legitimate operating conditions.

## IQR-Based Outlier Analysis

Using the standard statistical method (1.5Ã—IQR from Q1/Q3):

**Top 5 Variables by Outlier Percentage:**

| Variable | Mild Outliers | Extreme Outliers | Total | % of Data |
|----------|--------------|------------------|-------|-----------|
| T-215 | 17,197 | 101,702 | 118,899 | 29.25% |
| M-CompRack | 8,934 | 85,604 | 94,538 | 23.26% |
| **T-MTCase-Ret** | 27,491 | 53,757 | 81,248 | 19.99% |
| T-109 | 19,861 | 58,974 | 78,835 | 19.40% |
| T-MT-COMP3-SUC | 17,125 | 56,856 | 73,981 | 18.20% |

**Note:** These percentages seem high, but they reflect:
- Bimodal distributions (on/off states)
- Multi-modal distributions (different operating modes)
- Heavy-tailed distributions (occasional high-load conditions)

All are **expected for industrial control systems**.

## 95th Percentile Analysis

Values at or above the 95th percentile represent the **upper 5% of operating conditions** - typically:

- High-load scenarios
- Peak demand periods
- Extreme (but still normal) operating points

**Why keep them:**
1. **Reality**: These conditions WILL occur during real operation
2. **Anomaly detection**: Model needs to know what "high but normal" looks like
3. **Generalization**: Removing them would make model less robust
4. **Fault discrimination**: Helps distinguish "high load" from "actual fault"

## Comparison: Control Variables

Our newly added control variables show exactly the right characteristics:

| Control Variable | CV | Outlier % | Assessment |
|------------------|-----|-----------|------------|
| **T-MTCase-Ret** | 0.34 | 19.99% | âœ… Excellent - captures load variations |
| **T-MTCase-Sup** | 0.20 | 15.56% | âœ… Good - captures setpoint variations |
| T-LT_BPHX_H20_OUTLET | 0.03 | <5% | âœ… Stable - good external variable |
| T-FalseLoad | 0.03 | <5% | âœ… Stable - controlled test input |

The first two show **high variability** (good for capturing operating regimes), while the latter two are **stable** (good for external conditions).

## Recommendations

### âœ… DO NOT Remove Any Data

**Reasons:**
1. **All values are legitimate** - represent real system states
2. **Model needs diversity** - to learn robust normal behavior
3. **Control variables work better** - with high regime variability
4. **Generalization improves** - with more operating conditions

### âœ… What the Model Will Learn

With this diverse baseline data, the model will learn:

1. **Context-dependent normal behavior**
   - "High power is normal when load is high"
   - "Low temperatures are normal during low load"
   - "Cycling is normal during moderate load"

2. **Operating regime boundaries**
   - What's the maximum normal power consumption?
   - What's the range of normal temperatures?
   - When do compressors typically cycle?

3. **Control variable relationships**
   - How does T-MTCase-Ret correlate with power?
   - How does T-MTCase-Sup affect sensor readings?
   - How do ambient conditions influence system?

### âœ… Why This Helps Anomaly Detection

**Example Scenario:**
```
High Load (Normal):
  T-MTCase-Ret = 95Â°C (high load indicator)
  W_MT-COMP3 = 15 kW (all compressors running)
  â†’ Model sees: "High power is EXPECTED given high load"
  â†’ Anomaly score: LOW âœ…

Fault (Abnormal):
  T-MTCase-Ret = 45Â°C (normal load indicator)
  W_MT-COMP3 = 15 kW (excessive power for this load!)
  â†’ Model sees: "High power UNEXPECTED given normal load"
  â†’ Anomaly score: HIGH ðŸš¨
```

**Without diverse baseline data**, the model couldn't make this distinction!
